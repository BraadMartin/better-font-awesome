The better Font Awesome icon plugin for WordPress.

== Description ==

Better Font Awesome gives you easy access to the full [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/ "Font Awesome icon website") icon library. It is similar other Font Awesome plugins, but has a few major advantages:

*  *Choose your version* - Better Font Awesome lets you choose from an auto-updating list of all Font Awesome versions, meaning you'll never have to wait for the plugin author to add the latest version.

*  Insert icons using shortcodes, HTML, or TinyMCE.
*  Better Font Awesome shortcodes work across Font Awesome versions!
*  Better Font Awesome shortcodes are backwards compatible with most Font Awesome plugins ([Font Awesome Icons](http://wordpress.org/plugins/font-awesome/), [Font Awesome More Icons](https://wordpress.org/plugins/font-awesome-more-icons/), and [Font Awesome Shortcodes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/font-awesome-shortcodes/)) - this is super handy if you need to  
 Specify whe
 *  CDN CSS - all CSS is imported from 

 It's similar to the [Font Awesome Icons](http://wordpress.org/plugins/font-awesome/), [Font Awesome More Icons](https://wordpress.org/plugins/font-awesome-more-icons/), and [Font Awesome Shortcodes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/font-awesome-shortcodes/) plugins


== Description ==

This is the long description.  No limit, and you can use Markdown (as well as in the following sections).

For backwards compatibility, if this section is missing, the full length of the short description will be used, and
Markdown parsed.

A few notes about the sections above:

*   "Contributors" is a comma separated list of wp.org/wp-plugins.org usernames
*   "Tags" is a comma separated list of tags that apply to the plugin
*   "Requires at least" is the lowest version that the plugin will work on
*   "Tested up to" is the highest version that you've *successfully used to test the plugin*. Note that it might work on
higher versions... this is just the highest one you've verified.
*   Stable tag should indicate the Subversion "tag" of the latest stable version, or "trunk," if you use `/trunk/` for
stable.

    Note that the `readme.txt` of the stable tag is the one that is considered the defining one for the plugin, so
if the `/trunk/readme.txt` file says that the stable tag is `4.3`, then it is `/tags/4.3/readme.txt` that'll be used
for displaying information about the plugin.  In this situation, the only thing considered from the trunk `readme.txt`
is the stable tag pointer.  Thus, if you develop in trunk, you can update the trunk `readme.txt` to reflect changes in
your in-development version, without having that information incorrectly disclosed about the current stable version
that lacks those changes -- as long as the trunk's `readme.txt` points to the correct stable tag.

    If no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that trunk is stable, but you should specify "trunk" if that's where
you put the stable version, in order to eliminate any doubt.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place `<?php do_action('plugin_name_hook'); ?>` in your templates

== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets 
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png` 
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
